            <p>Hello friends.</p>
            <p>If you're reading this, one of these things may apply:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We were previously close, yet we haven't talked in months.</li>
                <li>You've messaged me somehow, but I never responded back.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If so, first and foremost out of the gate:</p>
            <p><strong>I'm sorry.</strong></p>
            <p>For anyone that I ignored or failed to contact, it wasn't because of <em>you</em>. 100% my fault. However, the reasons for not contacting individual people varies individually. For one of you, it was attempting to hide the fact that I'm still unemployed, even after all that preparation. For others, it was being afraid to explain why I'd dropped off the face of Earth for so long. Sometimes I just admired that person too much and feared I wouldn't be a good role model for them anymore if I updated them on my life. For all of you, it really boiled down to an irrational fear of being judged.</p>
            <p>Despite this, I would like to make clear that I still consider everyone who I was close to that I still care about them. For the people who have contacted me these past few months, just saying hello was a great morale boost and a gesture I appreciated a lot. Even though I didn't respond out of embarrassment, the message made me feel like I still mattered and lingered in some people's lives, even if it was a small part. For that, I am thankful.</p>
            <p>This website is a response to the fear that I described above, in the hopes that it will set the record straight with all the people who I care about and vice versa. It will be a struggle to start at first, since all the problems I stated above haven't gone anywhere anytime soon, but I hope that with this website, I can finally start reconnecting with the people I care about in my life again. For many of you, I have listened to your problems and supported you in your lives; I hope now that I can resume doing so, but now with me opening myself up to you too.</p>
