        <p>Hello friends and family. It’s time to break the silence. Here is my year in review.</p>

            <p>Since May, I have not sent a single resume, ever since I was rejected for a position as a lab manager. To hide this fact, I've made excuses, lied, or simply failed to respond. Since graduation, I have been losing against an emotional wall that seemed impossible to overcome; thankfully that outlook has grown more positive as of late. I’ve started to reconnect with people whom I have been silent towards, both literally and figuratively. This month marked making amends with my parents, who have been amazingly supportive thus far. I've started to consider my options again for moving forward in life, with many people in the conversation. This website is also a part of my recovery and will become my primary way of communicating news to those who care.</p>

            <p>In May, I had no confidence in myself, no direction, and years of bad emotional habits that left me frozen, ashamed, and stuck in a vicious cycle. December is still hurting, but I have hope. The cycle is breaking.</p>
            
            <p>There is so much more I want to say&mdash;the above is a gross simplification&mdash;but the basic message is this: this is the start of a very personal and very long conversation both with myself and those of you out there. It is a talk I've needed to have for the past five years. Although I face a fear of over-sharing myself to people who may not care enough, it is a risk I take, considering how painful and unproductive it was to be on the other side of that fence. </p>

            <p>This website will document my methods in identifying and resolving my fears, as well as tracking my progress towards my goals. Roadblocks will be faced, failure is imminent, but all of that and the good will be laid bare here. This will not be a blog of constant whining, but one of improvement, reflection, and frankness. If that isn't your cup of tea, that's absolutely fine. This website is for my own documentation and for the people in my life who want to be involved.</p>

            <p>For those of you who are staying, thank you for reading one of many posts detailing my journey to reclaim my confidence and faith in myself. Let this be a journey that we both walk together, through rain and shine.</p>
